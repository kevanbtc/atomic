# ESG System Documentation

## Overview
Complete ESG tokenization and CBDC bridge system for water credits, carbon credits, and sustainable finance.

## Architecture

### Core Contracts
- **WaterVault.sol** - Water resource tokenization with quality oracles
- **CarbonVault.sol** - Carbon credit issuance and trading
- **ESGStablecoin.sol** - Multi-collateral ESG-backed stablecoin
- **CBDCBridge.sol** - Cross-chain CBDC integration bridge

### Oracle System
- **MockWaterOracle.sol** - Water quality and pricing data
- **MockCarbonOracle.sol** - Carbon credit verification
- **MockPriceOracle.sol** - ESG scoring and price feeds
- **MockCBDCValidator.sol** - CBDC transaction validation

## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
npm run setup:dev      # Initialize development environment
npm run deploy:dev     # Deploy to localhost
npm run test:esg       # Run comprehensive tests
```

### Testnet Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy:testnet # Deploy to Sepolia testnet
npm run verify:sepolia # Verify contracts on Etherscan
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy:mainnet # Deploy to Ethereum mainnet
npm run verify:mainnet # Verify contracts on Etherscan
```

## Integration Guide

### Water Credit Flow
1. Register water source with quality verification
2. Mint water tokens based on oracle validation
3. Use water tokens as collateral in ESGStablecoin
4. Bridge to CBDC for institutional settlement

### Carbon Credit Flow
1. Issue carbon credits with project verification
2. Trade credits on secondary market
3. Retire credits for permanent offset
4. Use as stablecoin collateral for liquidity

### CBDC Integration
1. Institutional registration and KYC verification
2. Cross-chain bridge initialization with validators
3. Atomic swaps between ESG tokens and CBDCs
4. Compliance reporting and audit trails
