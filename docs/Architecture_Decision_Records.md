# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - ESG System

## ADR-001: Modular Contract Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Decision Makers**: System Architect Team  

### Context
Need to design a scalable ESG tokenization system that can handle water assets, carbon credits, stablecoins, and CBDC integration while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

### Decision
Implement a modular contract architecture with six core components:
- WaterVault: Water asset tokenization
- CarbonVault: Carbon credit management  
- ESGStablecoin: Asset-backed stablecoin
- CBDCBridge: CBDC integration
- ESGOracle: Data feed management
- ESGGovernance: Decentralized governance

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each contract handles specific functionality
- **Upgradeability**: Individual modules can be upgraded independently
- **Testing**: Easier to test and audit smaller, focused contracts
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different deployments
- **Risk Isolation**: Bugs in one module don't affect others

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better maintainability, clearer code organization, easier auditing
- **Negative**: Increased deployment complexity, more inter-contract calls

## ADR-002: ERC-20 Standard for Vault Shares

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-24

### Context
Need to choose token standard for representing shares in WaterVault and CarbonVault.

### Decision
Use ERC-20 standard for vault shares with additional metadata extensions.

### Rationale
- **DeFi Compatibility**: ERC-20 tokens work with all existing DeFi protocols
- **Liquidity**: Can be traded on AMMs like Uniswap
- **Composability**: Easy integration with lending protocols
- **Standardization**: Well-understood interface

### Alternatives Considered
- ERC-721: Rejected due to lack of fungibility
- ERC-1155: Rejected due to complexity and limited DeFi support

## ADR-003: Multi-Oracle Price Aggregation

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-24

### Context
Reliable price feeds are critical for collateralization calculations and asset valuations.

### Decision
Implement multi-source oracle aggregation with weighted averages and dispute mechanisms.

### Rationale
- **Reliability**: Multiple sources prevent single point of failure
- **Accuracy**: Weighted averages improve price accuracy
- **Security**: Dispute mechanisms prevent manipulation
- **Flexibility**: Can add/remove data providers dynamically

### Implementation
- Minimum 3 data providers per asset type
- Weight-based aggregation with reputation scoring
- 7-day dispute period with stake-based challenges
- Automatic failover for offline providers

## ADR-004: Over-Collateralization Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-24

### Context
ESGStablecoin needs to maintain USD peg while handling volatile ESG asset collateral.

### Decision
Implement 150% minimum collateralization ratio with dynamic adjustments.

### Rationale
- **Stability**: Higher ratios provide buffer against price volatility
- **Liquidation Safety**: Sufficient margin for liquidation processes
- **Market Confidence**: Over-collateralization builds user trust
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets traditional finance standards

### Risk Management
- Liquidation penalty: 10%
- Stability fees: 5% annual
- Emergency pause mechanisms
- Multi-asset diversification requirements

## ADR-005: Role-Based Access Control

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-24

### Context
System requires different permission levels for various operations.

### Decision
Use OpenZeppelin's AccessControl with custom roles:
- DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE: Full administrative access
- OPERATOR_ROLE: Day-to-day operations
- VERIFIER_ROLE: Asset verification authority
- ORACLE_ROLE: Data feed management
- MINTER_ROLE: Token minting authority
- LIQUIDATOR_ROLE: Position liquidation rights

### Rationale
- **Security**: Principle of least privilege
- **Auditability**: Clear permission tracking
- **Flexibility**: Roles can be granted/revoked dynamically
- **Standards Compliance**: Uses battle-tested OpenZeppelin implementation

## ADR-006: CBDC Integration Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-24

### Context
Need to integrate with multiple CBDCs while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### Decision
Implement bridge pattern with cross-chain proof verification and settlement delays.

### Key Features
- Multi-CBDC support (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CNY)
- 5-minute settlement delays for verification
- Daily transaction limits per user
- Cross-chain proof validation
- Automated compliance reporting

### Rationale
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Settlement delays allow compliance checks
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple CBDC implementations
- **Security**: Cross-chain proofs prevent double-spending
- **Flexibility**: Can add new CBDCs without system changes

## ADR-007: Governance Model Selection

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-24

### Context
Need governance system that represents diverse stakeholder interests.

### Decision
Implement multi-stakeholder governance with quadratic voting and role-based weightings.

### Stakeholder Categories
- Token Holders (100% base weight)
- Validators (150% weight)
- Asset Owners (200% weight)
- Regulators (300% weight)
- Community (120% weight)

### Rationale
- **Fairness**: Quadratic voting prevents plutocracy
- **Representation**: Different stakeholders have appropriate influence
- **Expertise**: Domain experts have higher voting power
- **Legitimacy**: Broad stakeholder participation increases legitimacy

## ADR-008: Layer 2 Scaling Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-24

### Context
High gas costs on Ethereum mainnet limit system accessibility.

### Decision
Deploy on multiple Layer 2 solutions with cross-rollup compatibility.

### Target Networks
- Arbitrum: Primary L2 deployment
- Optimism: Secondary deployment
- Polygon: Alternative L2 option
- Base: Coinbase ecosystem integration

### Bridge Strategy
- Lock-and-mint for asset transfers
- Native L2 token issuance where possible
- Cross-rollup liquidity sharing
- Unified interface across chains
